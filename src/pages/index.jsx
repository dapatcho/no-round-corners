        Hey, Iâ€™m Michael (he/they), web developer and civil engineering
        graduate. Additionally, a radio show host, DIY music organizer,
        performer, and graphic designer. I love music, have an obsession with
        coffee, and clearly wear too many hats.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am pursuing web dev work to better align my creative tendencies and
        work in faster paced and more engaging environments. I bring a wealth of
        professional experience working at civil engineering consultancies. I am
        extremely familiar working with moving targets and a plethora of
        stakeholders, where I consistently turn over quality work.
