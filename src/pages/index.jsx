          Hey, Iâ€™m Michael, web developer and civil engineering graduate.
          Additionally, a radio show host, DIY music organizer, performer, and
          graphic designer. I love music, have an obsession with coffee, and
          clearly wear too many hats.
        </p>
        <BufferBar accentColor="var(--accent)" />
        {/* <br/> */}
        <p>
          I am pursuing web dev work to better align my creative tendencies and
          work in faster paced and more engaging environments. I bring a wealth
          of professional experience working at civil engineering consultancies.
          I am extremely familiar working with moving targets and a plethora of
          stakeholders, where I consistently turn over quality work.
